# Snapchat-Clone
Snapchat Clone using Firebase, Redux and Material UI with CSS using BEM for a structured design. - Features Google authentication, and hosting.

## Lessons Learned 
A real understanding working with Redux hooks and firebase as a backend. The app also features various react packages such as webcam from react-webcam.
This project features react-router-dom v6 using navigate and useNavigate hooks instead of useHistory. A fundamental approach to my learning process is pattern recognition.
